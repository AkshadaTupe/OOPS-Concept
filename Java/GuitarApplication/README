Part 1
1. Customer Can Search Guitar Based on Serial Number
2. Customer Can Search by sending specific type, model, or wood type

Part 2
Fixed Part1 Bug
Replaced String With Enum for few parameters which will provide compile-time type checking, reducing errors from passing invalid strings.

Advantages of Using Enum Over String
1. Avoid getting bad data for anything that has a standard range or set of legal values.
