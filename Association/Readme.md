# Association in Object-Oriented Programming

An association in object-oriented programming represents a relationship between two classes. 

This relationship indicates that objects of one class are connected to objects of another class. 

Associations can be categorized into different types based on the directionality of the relationship.

## Types of Associations

**1. Unidirectional Association**

In a unidirectional association, one class knows about or uses the other class, but the reverse is not true. 
This is useful when one class needs to reference another class, but there is no need for the second class to be aware of the first class.

**2. Bidirectional Association**

In a bidirectional association, both classes are aware of and can use each other. This allows for a more interconnected relationship where both classes can interact with each other.

## Summary

Associations in object-oriented programming are crucial for defining relationships between classes.

Understanding the different types of associations (unidirectional and bidirectional) helps in designing systems where objects can interact with each other effectively and efficiently. 

The example code for both unidirectional and bidirectional associations is available in the **Association.sln** solution file.
